My Name is Michael and I go to STEM ECHS. I am in school to get my associates in Computer information Systems.
I really enjoy just sitting outside when it is Sunny with a bit of breeze. Most of time I am listeng to music doing homework.
One of my favorite things to do is ti take Dubs or Give Ls.(Win and give people losses) I have loads of pride and most of the time i will not admit i am wrong.
When im not doing homework im most likey procrastinating or asleep. I often eat tuna or Whataburger. I laugh way too much.

One of my favorite songs is There's Nothing Holding Me Back
<p><br><br></p>

I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause everytime that she gets closer

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

She says that she is never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
'Cause if you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright
If you are by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we'd be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
